![[KoopaTroopa.png|70]]KT: "Oh...what the...oh...hi dude!
Where are you fr...err...maybe it's not important. Welcome to the Kamek magical secret library! 
I'm Koopa Troopa, nice to have you here!!

Here you can find all the knowledge of the Universe!
Come on, look around!! It's amazing, isn't it?"

\**Koopa Troopa stares at the library with a big smirk on their face*\*

\**Coughs*\*

KT: "Well...this library has a very long history...actually our story starts long time ago...when the Shroobs attacked the Mushroom Kingdom. 
Do you remember?
Well, after that, Professor E. Gadd..."

\**While Koopa Troopa is telling you the story, a voice yells*\*

K: "**KOOPA TROOPA!!!!**" 

\**Koopa Troopa flinches*\*

K: "How many times do I have to say that? You don't have to preach to newcomers.
Nobody cares about this old boring story!!!"



![[KoopaTroopa.png|70]] KT: "Oh I'm sorry, Kamek! I was just trying to entertain our new guest"

\**Kamek sighs putting a hand on his face in dismay*\*


K: "So...welcome to my secret library newcomer!!  Here you can find all the knowledge of the Universe!
...err...maybe you already know this story...*

\**Kamek coughs*\*

K: "By the way, you can read and learn everything from here...and...huh...what? What are you saying? You are interested in the computer science section?!
Oh...in that case i can explain you how this section works"


\**Kamek adjusts his hat*\*
