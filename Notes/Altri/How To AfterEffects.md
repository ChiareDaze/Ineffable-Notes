### Interface

The After Effects interface consists of several panels that enable you to work with projects, effects, and animations.

**Project**
This panel shows all the important elements of the project such as files or compositions.

**Composition**
It is a window that displays a composition, allowing you to preview, arrange, and edit the visual elements, layers and settings of a project in a *WYSIWYG* (What You See Is What You Get) environment.

### How to create a project and import a file

When creating a new file, the first time you open After Effects, a window will appear asking whether you want to create a new project or open an existing one.

![[Pasted image 20250714233143.png|400]]

To create a new project, click on *New Project*. Otherwise, select *Open Project* and and select the file based on its location in the directories.

Once the project is open, the main interface of After Effects will be displayed (as previously explained). So, the next step is to create a composition and import the files you want to use and then edit them as needed.

In the *Composition panel*, click on the *New Composition* option, which will open a window where you need to specify the composition's properties (height, width, frame rate, etc.).

After creating the composition, to import files, navigate to the top left corner of the screen and click on the *File* menu. A dropdown menu will appear, from which you should select *Import*. Then, choose the files you wish to import into your project.

Now, all your files will be listed in the *Project panel*. The last step is to select the individual files and drag them onto the *Timeline panel*.
