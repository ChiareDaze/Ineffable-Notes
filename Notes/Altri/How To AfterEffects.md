The After Effects interface consists of several panels that enable you to work with projects, effects, and animations.

**Project**
This panel shows all the important elements of the project such as files or compositions.

**Composition**
It is a window that displays a composition, allowing you to preview, arrange, and edit the visual elements, layers and settings of a project in a *WYSIWYG* (What You See Is What You Get) environment.
